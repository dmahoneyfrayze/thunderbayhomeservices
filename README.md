## Post-Fix Build Notes

The `QuoteForm.tsx` JSX tags have been balanced and styled. Build passing locally confirms no syntax errors.

### Next Steps
1. Confirm the updated form placement and styling on the live site.
2. Verify form submissions route correctly via MCP (check GHL pipeline).
3. Merge any additional SEO cleanup or branding tweaks.
